# Shopping List App

This repository is a shopping list assignment from an online coding bootcamp, [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com). My contribution to this project ranged from concept to completion which includes: wireframes, asset creation, layout, and code. Check out the [code](https://github.com/karnolttl/shopping-list/blob/master/js/app.js) and don't forget to checkout the [app](https://karnolttl.github.io/shopping-list/).

*Please note that the remaining functionality includes editing and removing saved lists.*
